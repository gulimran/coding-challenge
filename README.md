## Algorithms

### Sorting

1.  A function to merge two arrays of integers into a single sorted array.
2. A function to merge two arrays of integers into a single sorted array,  using a non-collection based algorithm.

## Concurrency

### Thread Safety

1. Creates a thread-safe singleton class

## Data-Structures

### Arrays / Collections

1. A Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers a, b, and c, such that a^2 + b^2 = c^2. Such a triple is commonly written (a, b, c), and a well-known example is (3, 4, 5).  Another example is (8, 15, 17). Implement the method Solution.containsPythagoras(final Collection numbers) returns a boolean that returns true if any three numbers in the collection form a Pythagorean triple, otherwise return false.

### Strings

1. A function to find the first non-repeating character in a string.

## Design

### Reactive

1. Implement a simple rate limiter that allows N requests per minute per user.

## Files

### Read

1. Count unique words in a given file.
