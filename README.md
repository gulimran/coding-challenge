## Project

- Spring boot application
- Java 17
- Gradle using gradle wrapper version 8.11.1
- TDD approach using JUnit 
- [TestService](https://github.com/gulimran/coding-challenge/blob/fe3729e3710dc6c9941d8ba419fede76c5768e49/src/main/java/imran/coding/challenge/service/TestService.java) to run through all challenges when app is run using `bootRun`.  It uses a command line runner.

# Challenges

## Algorithms

### Sorting

1.  A function to merge two arrays of integers into a single sorted array.
2. A function to merge two arrays of integers into a single sorted array,  using a non-collection based algorithm.

## Concurrency

### Thread Safety

1. Creates a thread-safe singleton class

## Data-Structures

### Arrays / Collections

1. A Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers a, b, and c, such that a^2 + b^2 = c^2. Such a triple is commonly written (a, b, c), and a well-known example is (3, 4, 5).  Another example is (8, 15, 17). Implement the method Solution.containsPythagoras(final Collection numbers) returns a boolean that returns true if any three numbers in the collection form a Pythagorean triple, otherwise return false.

### Strings

1. A function to find the first non-repeating character in a string.

### Palindrome

1. A word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. madam or nurses run. Determine whether the given string is a palindrome or not.

## Design

### Reactive

1. Implement a simple rate limiter that allows N requests per minute per user.

## Files

### Read

1. Count unique words in a given file.
